\description{
This is a VIRTUAL class that extends SummarizedExperiment to
   to model a Methylation Experiment where the idea is to contain all the
   data in a single object instead of having multiple copies across the
   analysis pipeline, e. g., raw, normalized, filtered objects, etc. This
   class is then extended into concrete clases according to the distribution
   imposed in the analysis, i. e., normal (limma style), beta (betareg style)
   or any other distribution based implemented class.

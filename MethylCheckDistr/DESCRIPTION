Description: This package is designed to work with the workflow published by 
    Oshlack et al.(doi:10.12688/f1000research.8839.3). Methylation array data
    from Illumina Infinium 450k is analized.The original pipeline analize
    quality control, filtering, normalization, data exploration and statistical
    testing for probe-wise differential methylation. This package is designed
    to evaluate the probe distribution, classify them according to CpG position
    and check if the distributions change on different experimental conditions.
